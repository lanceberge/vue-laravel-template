      <TermsOfServiceSection header="Agreement to Arbitrate" type="secondary">
        This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms as the
        “Arbitration Agreement.” You and {{ name }} agree that any and all disputes, claims,
        demands, or causes of action (“Claims”) that have arisen or may arise between you and us,
        whether arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Site, or any aspect of the
        relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and
        binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator, rather than in a court by a judge or jury,
        in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you or we may (but
        are not required to) assert individual Claims in small claims court if such Claims are
        within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not
        preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and
        such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that,
        by entering into these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
        participate in a class action and that our respective rights will be determined by a neutral
        arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
        enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any claim or cause of action
        arising out of or related to these Terms, the Site, or any services provided must be filed
        within one (1) year after the event or facts giving rise to the claim or cause of action
        occurred. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any claims or causes of action not
        filed within this period are permanently barred.

        YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL
        BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION
        OR PROCEEDING.
      </TermsOfServiceSection>

      <TermsOfServiceSection header="Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution" type="secondary">
        Before commencing any arbitration (or suit in small claims court, if available), you agree
        to provide {{ name }} with a written notice of Claim, and {{ name }} agrees to provide you
        with a written notice of Claim to the extent reasonably possible based on the availability
        of your contact information to {{ name }} (“Notice”). The Notice to {{ name }} shall be sent
        to <SupportEmail />. Where {{ name }} has your contact information, {{ name }} will send its
        Notice to you using the last email address we have on file for you if you have provided us
        with an email address (each, a “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature
        and basis of the Claim in sufficient detail to evaluate the merits of the claiming party’s
        Claim and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought, including the amount of money (if any)
        that is demanded and the means by which the demanding party calculated the claimed amount.
        Both parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a Claim through informal negotiation
        within sixty (60) calendar days from the date the Notice is received. If the Claim is not
        resolved within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or we may
        commence an arbitration proceeding. Each party agrees that state and federal courts in
        Singapore, may enter injunctive relief to enforce the pre-filing requirements of this
        paragraph, including an injunction to stay an arbitration that has been commenced in
        violation of this paragraph.
      </TermsOfServiceSection>

      <TermsOfServiceSection header="Arbitration Procedures" type="secondary">
        The Federal Arbitration Act fully applies to the Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration will
        be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration
        Association’s (“AAA”) Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time that such arbitration
        is initiated (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.
        Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found on the AAA’s
        consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency
        between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable
        terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control. The arbitrator must also follow the
        provisions of these Terms as a court would. Except as set forth above, all issues are for
        the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, threshold issues relating to the
        scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement and issues relating
        to (a) whether the terms of these Terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable,
        unconscionable, or illusory and (b) any defence to arbitration, including waiver, delay,
        laches, or estoppel. During arbitration proceedings, the amount of any settlement offer made
        by {{ name }} or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. Although arbitration
        proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial
        proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis
        that a court can award to an individual under these Terms and applicable law. While an
        arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the arbitrator may do so only with
        respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
        relief warranted by the individual party’s Claim. The arbitrator’s decision and judgment
        thereon will not have a precedent or collateral estoppel effect on any other Claim.
        Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only
        <!-- TODO -->
        for very limited reasons. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the United States in
        Virginia, at another mutually agreeable location or, if both parties agree, by telephone or
        video conference. Whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
        submitted to the arbitrator or by a hearing will be determined in accordance with the AAA
        Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will
        issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and
        conclusions on which the award is based.
      </TermsOfServiceSection>

      <TermsOfServiceSection header="Small Claims Court" type="secondary">
        Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, either party may elect to pursue a Claim
        in a local small claims court rather than through arbitration so long as the matter remains
        in a small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis.
      </TermsOfServiceSection>

      <TermsOfServiceSection header="Cost of Arbitration" type="secondary">
        Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration
        Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration
        Agreement. If you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator’s satisfaction that you are
        economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator
        otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of
        the Arbitration Fees, we will pay your portion of such fees, subject to allocation in the
        arbitrator’s award. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of
        arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much
        of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from
        being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorney’s fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
      </TermsOfServiceSection>

      <TermsOfServiceSection header="Confidentiality" type="secondary">
        Each of the parties shall maintain the strictly confidential nature of the arbitration,
        including all aspects of the arbitration proceeding and any ruling, decision, or award by
        the arbitrator, and shall not (without the prior written consent of the other party)
        disclose to any third party the fact, existence, content, award, or other results of the
        arbitration, except as may be necessary to enforce, enter, or challenge such award in a
        court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by law.
      </TermsOfServiceSection>

      <TermsOfServiceSection header="Opt Out" type="secondary">
        You may reject this Arbitration Agreement, in which case only a court may be used to resolve
        any Claim. To reject this provision, you must send us an opt-out notice (the “Opt Out”)
        within thirty (30) days after you first access the Site. The Opt-Out must be sent to the
        {{ name }} Notice Address. The Opt-Out must include your name, phone number and the email
        address you used to sign up and use the Site. This is the only way of opting out of this
        Arbitration Agreement. Opting out will not affect any other aspect of these Terms and will
        have no effect on any other or future agreements you may reach to arbitrate with us.

      <TermsOfServiceSection header="Severability" type="secondary">
        If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration
        Agreement (other than Paragraph 2) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative
        Actions and Non-Individualised Relief” is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to
        replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable, and
        that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
        provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or
        the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of Paragraph 2 above, titled “Prohibition
        of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualised Relief” are invalid or
        unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless
        such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to Claims for
        public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.
